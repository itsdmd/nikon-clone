# Nikon's Homepage Clone

This is a clone of Nikon's Global homepage built without using any framework. It referenced the [older version](https://web.archive.org/web/20230201013612/https://www.nikon.com/) of the website since I made this as the [midterm assignment](https://github.com/itsdmd/University/tree/2.2/CS201/T/w06) of my _Introduction to Web Development_ course back in February 2023.

You can see the version history of the project [here](https://github.com/itsdmd/University/commits/2.2/CS201/T/w06).
